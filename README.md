# generate_faces

## Setup instructions

For a much quicker installation, you can download pregenerated data.

To do that: 

1. Download the gen_faces directory.
2. Load it to the base directory in your google drive.

If you want to project the latent vectors and/or generate the 
attribute directions yourself, you can simply delete them from the
directory. Note that projecting the images can take up to 2 days, generating the 
directions takes ~15 minutes.
