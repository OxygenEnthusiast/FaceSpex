# generate_faces

## Setup instructions

For a much quicker installation, you can download pregenerated data.

To do that: 

1. Download the gen_faces directory.
2. Load it to the base directory in your google drive.

If you want to project the latent vectors and/or generate the 
attribute directions yourself, you can simply delete them from the
directory. Note that projecting the images can take up to 2 days, generating the 
directions takes ~15 minutes.

To run the script open 
[gen_faces.ipynb](https://github.com/OxygenEnthusiast/generate_faces/blob/main/gen_face.ipynb)
and click ''open on colab'' on top of the notebook.
In colab sign in with the google account you used 
for the google drive. To connect your google drive click on ''files'' and then click 
''Mont Drive''. You should now be able to use the notebook. Feel free 
to change the form fields. To run the notebook you can click on 
''Runtime'' -> ''Run all''. To save time you can simply run the last
cell (''Main Code'') for any subsequent runs,
